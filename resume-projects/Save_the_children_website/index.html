        <h2>Save Our Children</h2>
        <p>A vast majority of children are disadvantaged from the day they start living.
        Here at Save Our Children we care about those disadvantaged and try to help them.</p>
        <p>
       Today we lie with numbers of children who were affected by the pandemic and virus leaving them without food, parents and poverty. They face the worst kind of mulnutrition and hunger. </p>
       <p>
       Their right to survival, protection and education is under immediate threat. But, we can do something about it. Help us protect children to ensure they not only survive but thrive.
       </p>
       <p>
       How do we do it?
       The Save the Children movement has agreed a common ‘theory of change’ which incorporates a three-tier approach:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>Helping millions of children hand to hand through our programmes.</li>
      <li>Research proves that we can help convince advantaged people to donate in our cause.</li>
      <li>Logistically mobilising help in mass.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Our Successes</h2>
    <p>With the help we get from the millions of our doners, we are able to house and protect the thousands of disadvantaged children so that their futures are brighter taht before with access to education as well as health services.
       With more than 70 years that we've been helping people, the future looks bright for those seeking help as there are families at the moment who are enjoying the help the got from us.
       Our videos and pictures show how we've so far helped the communites in need and how the future will be benefiting from our cause.
      1 Donation and change the world, and that one donation can be you. Be sure to donate whatever you can to feed an disadvantaged child.</p>
