  <h2>Saving Our Future Heros</h2>
  <p>Too many children still start life at a disadvantage simply because of who they are and where they are from.
 We are gravely concerned for children around the world caught in the middle of armed conflict in countries such as Afghanistan and Ukraine.
 A perfect storm of COVID-19, conflict and the climate crisis has left children vulnerable to critical levels of hunger and poverty. They are facing the worst global food crisis in decades.
 Their right to survival, protection and education is under immediate threat. But, we can do something about it. Help us protect children to ensure they not only survive but thrive.
 How do we do it?
 The Save the Children movement has agreed a common ‘theory of change’ which incorporates a three-tier approach:

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p><div id="quote" >“Change is within reach – if we have courage, determination, imagination and effective organisation” -Eglantyne Jebb-</div>
  The story of Save the Children is one of hope and deeply passionate and committed people, determined to make the world a better place for all our children.
  It began with one woman who changed the world’s response to children in need.
  19 May 1919:  Eglantyne Jebb launched a worldwide movement - the Save the Children Fund. She was driven by the belief that all children have the right to a healthy, happy and fulfilling life.
  1923: Jebb drafted the first Declaration of the Rights of the Child - one of the central inspirations for the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which is also our foundation to continue Eglantyne Jebb’s work - long-term improvement of children’s lives and the realisation of their rights.
  1944: Save the Children started their work in South Africa with children and their families in some of the most marginalised communities.
  2013: A proudly South African entity was formed - Save the Children South Africa – to fight for local children’s rights. Save the Children South Africa became an official member of Save the Children International thanks to the merger of Save the Children Gauteng, Save the Children KwaZulu-Natal, Save the Children UK and Savethe Children Sweden.
